```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

Tidyverse is a set of eight different packages, loads them all quickly which is more efficient.
let's import the `FAS_litters.csv` csv


```{r}
litters_df =
  read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv")

litters_df =
  janitor::clean_names(litters_df)


```


Janitor command with "clean_names" above cleans up the column names automatically (adds an underscore in place of spaces). Syntax basically says "load this one cammand (clean names) from within janitor package"

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
