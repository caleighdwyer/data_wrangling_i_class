##pulse dataset

haven helps us read data, specifically read_sas helps with sas files

in the original dataset, the bdi score and each visit was spread across several variables. below changes from y format to long format, so that all those variables are values of one combined variable (visit) and then bdi_score

will do extra tidying to make sure naming convention is consistent across bdi_scores

in a mutate statement, replace is used to change values in one variable to another value
```{r}
pulse_df =
  haven::read_sas("data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m,
    names_to = "visit",
    values_to = "bdi_score",
    names_prefix = "bdi_score_"
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    visit = replace(visit, visit == "bl", "00m")
  )


pulse_df
```
